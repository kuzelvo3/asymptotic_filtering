# asymptotic_filtering

This repository contains files with calculations for the homogenized equations of the heterogeneous filtration example presented in the thesis.

## Contents:
- **FlexPDE**: Notebook `CellProblem.pde`contains the numerical evaluation of the cell problem for a given porosity value. The results of the cell problem for multiple porosity values are stored in the folder `CellProblem_Results`.
- **Mathematica**: Notebook `Calculations.nb` processes the FlexPDE results, as well as additional numerical and asymptotic solutions presented in the thesis. File `Calculations.m` contains a script version of the Mathematica notebook.

The repository provides all the necessary files to replicate the calculations and analysis presented in the work.
